# Added Value of Machine Learning in Mortgage Lending
In this repo you will find the notebooks where I conduct data wrangling, cleaning, and analysis for my Master's Thesis at the Barcelona Graduate School of Economics (Finance Program). You will also find some of my thesis's content in explanatory notebooks walking the reader through the machine learning algorithms I use.

This repo is a rather odd hodge-podge of thoughts and analysis that I threw together to complete my thesis. It may be difficult to decode. The "final product" is available on my website www.imabikumar.com under the academic projects section. Note this is not a completed project. It simply my method to producing the paper.
